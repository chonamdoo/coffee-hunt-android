                            <p> a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
                                grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
                                license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
                                publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
                                Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and
                                object code form.</p>
                            <p> b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
                                grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
                                license
                                under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and
                                otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in
                                source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to
                                the
                                combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the
                                Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the
                                Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed
                                Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
                                combinations
                                which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed
                                hereunder.</p>
                            <p> c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
                                licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
                                provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
                                patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
                                Each
                                Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought
                                by
                                any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property
                                rights
                                or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses
                                granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility
                                to
                                secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For
                                example, if a third party patent license is required to allow
                                Recipient
                                to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
                                acquire
                                that license before distributing the Program.</p>
                            <p> d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
                                sufficient
                                copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
                                license set forth in this Agreement.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li value="3"><p>REQUIREMENTS</p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
                        its
                        own license agreement, provided that:</p>
                    <p> a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</p>
                    <p> b) its license agreement:</p>
                    <p> i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
                        conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
                        and
                        non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
                        and
                        fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
                    <p> ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
                        damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
                        damages, such as lost profits;</p>
                    <p> iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered
                        by
                        that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and</p>
                    <p> iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
                        Contributor,
                        and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through
                        a
                        medium customarily used for software exchange.</p>
                    <p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>
                    <p> a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>
                    <p> b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
                        Program.</p>
                    <p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within
                        the
                        Program.</p>
                    <p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,
                        if
                        any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify
                        the
                        originator of the Contribution.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li value="4">COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
                        respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
                        intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor
                        who
                        includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
                        manner
                        which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,
                        if<br>a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,
                        such<br>Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and
                        indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
                        losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims,
                        lawsuits
                        and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
                        Contributor to the<br>extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
                        Commercial
                        Contributor in<br>connection with its distribution of the Program in a
                        commercial product<br>offering. The obligations in this section do not apply
                        to
                        any claims or Losses<br>relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
                        property
                        infringement. In order<br>to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
                        promptly notify the Commercial<br>Contributor in writing of such claim, and
                        b)
                        allow the Commercial Contributor<br>to control, and cooperate with the
                        Commercial Contributor in, the defense and<br>any related settlement
                        negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may<br>participate in any such
                        claim
                        at its own expense.</p>
                    <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
                        product<br>offering,
                        Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that<br>Commercial
                        Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties<br>related
                        to
                        Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such<br>Commercial
                        Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the<br>Commercial
                        Contributor would have to defend claims against the other<br>Contributors
                        related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court<br>requires
                        any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial<br>Contributor
                        must pay those damages.</p>

                    <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any<br>entity (including a

                        always be distributed subject to the version of<br>the Agreement under which
                        it
                        was received. In addition, after a new version of<br>the Agreement is
